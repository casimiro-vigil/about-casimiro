	<p>First of all.  My name is a little hard to pronounce, so I go by Cass.
		I was born a long long time ago in a little town in Northern New Mexico.  I moved to Albuquerque when I was 4.
		I served for 21 years in the US Army.  I retired in 2003 and began working as an Army Contractor.</p>
		<p>This is the first time I have had to create code completely from scratch.</p>
